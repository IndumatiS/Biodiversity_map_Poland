The following set of files were created to produce an Rshiny application which showcases animal biodiversity across a certain period within Poland region. The data is derived from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. The data was downloaded into the local folder, and was then filtered for keyword "Poland" using _grep_ within the Bash environment. 

The filtered file was then processed as follows:
- Added colnames
- Added appropriate class types to the columns

The final processed file was then used to create the Rshiny application.
